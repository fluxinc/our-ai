# Onboarding

`my` has two setup-shaped commands with different jobs:

- `my onboarding` is the guided first-run experience. In an interactive
  terminal it launches a harness and starts a learn-by-example walkthrough. The
  operator opens a second terminal or split pane, runs small sets of validated
  `my` commands, and confirms each set before the model continues.
- `my onboarding --no-agent` is the deterministic walkthrough. It explains the
  model and points at `my setup --interactive` without launching a harness.
- `my setup` is the machine configurator. It remains deterministic and safe for
  scripts; add `--interactive` only when you want prompts.

`my onboard` remains available as a compatibility alias.

## First Run

```sh
my onboarding
```

When a single logged-in harness is detected, `my` launches it. If none is
logged in but exactly one supported harness is installed, `my` launches that
harness. If the choice is ambiguous, `my` asks which harness to use. Pass
`--harness codex`, `--harness claude-code`, `--harness opencode`,
`--harness antigravity`, `--harness grok`, or `--harness cursor` to skip
detection.

The launched model starts by greeting the operator and immediately sets up the
split-pane workflow. It gives a small first command set, waits for the operator
to confirm whether it worked, and then continues one set at a time. The normal
path is conversational: ask whether the command worked, answer questions, and
move on. If something fails or the operator is unsure, the model can offer
read-only checks such as `my doctor`, but verification is support, not a hard
gate.

The walkthrough detects whether this machine is authoring a new organization or
joining an existing one:

- With no registered manifest, the harness starts from the current directory
  and takes the AUTHOR branch. The model interviews the operator, asks for
  approval before presenting `my init`, then walks through the smallest useful
  local setup and verification path: `my setup`, `my doctor`, harness launch,
  work sessions, and sync.
- With a registered manifest, the launcher reuses the normal
  `my ai --setup --no-session` path and takes the JOIN branch. The model helps
  pick a role when needed, has the operator run setup, pulls workspace content,
  and teaches the basic daily loop: launch a harness, start/resume/finish a
  work session, run pull-only `my sync`, preview publish with
  `my sync --push --print`, publish with `my sync --push`, and run `my doctor`.

Onboarding deliberately avoids teaching the full CLI. For meeting transcripts,
fleet/support context, notes, screenshots, or issue details, the human should
paste the raw context into the harness chat. Agents are the primary operators
and can choose the right deeper `my` commands when records need to be created.

If a selected launch skill already exists from a manual install or old
workspace rename, interactive onboarding asks whether to replace or skip that
entry and then continues launching the harness.

The launcher itself does not publish anything. The onboarding guidance keeps
publish at the end: the model must have the operator run `my publish --print`,
review the planned remotes and pushes, and get explicit human approval before
the real `my publish`.

## Deterministic Walkthrough

Use the non-agent path in scripts, CI, or terminals where you only want the
fixed setup review:

```sh
my onboarding --no-agent
```

If no manifest is registered, the walkthrough prints the registration command
to run once you have the manifest URL:

```sh
my manifests add <name> <git-url>
```

No umbrella-local tour state is written until setup has created or loaded the
umbrella. Once a manifest is available, the walkthrough explains the control
plane and data plane, shows what setup will change, and offers to run:

```sh
my setup --interactive
```

## Reconfigure Later

Use setup directly:

```sh
my setup --interactive
```

The interactive path can choose among registered manifests and select a role.
Enter `none` at the role prompt to clear the selected role and return to
unscoped guidance/services. Plain `my setup` never prompts, including on a TTY.

## Repeat Onboarding

Run `my onboarding` again when you want the model to re-introduce and review
the workspace with the operator. Use `my onboarding --no-agent` for a read-only
status review that reports the umbrella, selected role, and next commands
without silently re-running setup.

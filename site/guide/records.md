# Records: Customers, Meetings, Support, Fleet

Workspace content is markdown records with frontmatter, living in mounted
content repos. Customer identities are read from mounted `customers/*.md`
records, and each record domain exposes write-oriented commands. `my sync
--push` publishes adopted changes.

```sh
my customers list [--json]
my customers list --identity --json
my customers add <domain|slug> [--name TEXT] [--domain DOMAIN] [--domain-confirmed] [--alias TEXT] [--partner ID]

my meetings list [--since DATE] [--customer ID] [--partner ID] [--json]
my meetings search <text>
my meetings get <id|path>
my meetings add <slug> [--date DATE] [--title TEXT] [--customer ID] [--attendees NAME] [--partner ID]

my support list [--since DATE] [--customer ID] [--identifier ID] [--claimed-by MEMBER] [--product ID] [--area TEXT] [--tag TEXT] [--feature-candidate] [--json]
my support search <text>
my support get <id|path>
my support add <slug> [--customer ID] [--identifier ID]... [--claimed-by MEMBER] [--observed-by MEMBER]... [--product ID] [--area TEXT] [--status open|workaround|resolved]

my fleet list [--status TEXT] [--customer ID] [--identifier ID] [--branch NAME] [--where KEY=VALUE] [--json]
my fleet search <text>
my fleet get <id|identifier|path>
my fleet add <id> [--customer ID] [--status TEXT] [--device TEXT] [--serial TEXT] [--identifier ID]...
my fleet set <id> KEY=VALUE...
```

Bare `my meetings` and `my support` use their safest useful action: they list
records and accept the same filters as `list`. Subcommands remain available
for search, retrieval, and creation.

When the `qmd` tool is installed, `search` uses it for higher-quality
retrieval; otherwise a built-in scan applies. Single keywords match best.

## Customer records

Customer identities live under `customers/*.md` in a mounted content repo, not
in the manifest. Use `my customers add <domain|slug>` to scaffold one. A
minimal record is:

```md
---
id: sampleco.example.com
name: SampleCo
domain: sampleco.example.com
domain_confirmed: true
aliases:
  - sampleco
  - sc
partners:
  - integratorco
---

# SampleCo
```

`my customers list` reads these records, and customer filters accept IDs,
domains, names, and aliases.

`my customers list --identity --json > customer-identities.json` generates a
deterministic, least-privilege artifact for detached repository CI. The artifact
contains only canonical IDs, domains, aliases, and source revision/freshness
metadata; it omits names, partner links, note bodies, and local paths. Generate
it where the customer mount is available, then provide only the JSON artifact
to the detached job. Generation fails distinctly when the source is
unavailable, dirty, or out of sync, so CI can distinguish an empty identity set
from an untrustworthy projection.

## Meetings

A meeting note is a dated journal entry: what was discussed, decided, and
assigned. `my meetings add <slug>` scaffolds the record in the meetings
content root; a slug that starts with `YYYY-MM-DD` sets the date. Attendees
and partners are repeatable flags, each occurrence one literal value.

## Support records

A support record is an anonymized problem-to-solution story: problem, context,
solution, validation. The body stays anonymized; linkable attribution lives in
frontmatter:

- `--customer` — the canonical customer ID (see `my customers list`).
- `--identifier`, repeatable — every device, order, workstation, or asset
  identifier that applies, so recurrence on the same equipment is
  discoverable later.
- `--claimed-by` — the org member who worked it; `--observed-by`, repeatable,
  for others involved.
- `approved_by` stays empty unless the operator explicitly signs off.

## Fleet records

The fleet is a registry, not a journal: one record per deployed instance,
keyed by a stable id, updated in place. State history is the record's git log.

`my fleet get` resolves *any* identifier — sales order, functional location,
serial, hostname — and lists related support records found by shared
identifiers. Its output ends with the concrete next step: a seeded
`my support add` command carrying the customer and every identifier, ready to
run when no relevant record exists yet.

Record workflow transitions with `my fleet set <id> status=<value>`, then
publish with the suggested `my sync --push --message` command so each transition is
a readable git commit.

The built-in fleet work contract ties these together — see
[Guidance and Contract](./guidance-and-contract.md).

## Adoption: why your file did not publish

`my sync --push` only publishes content it knows is intentional. Records created
by the CLI are adopted automatically (Git intent-to-add). A file you created by
hand stays held until you adopt it:

```sh
my record adopt <path>
```

This is the difference between "scratch file that happens to be in a content
mount" and "record the organization should see."

## Sessions and records

When your current directory is inside an active session (`sessions/<id>`),
record commands write to that session's mount worktree instead of the base
mount — session work does not leak until you finish the session. See
[Sessions](./sessions.md).

Pending session work only holds a base publish or land when the changed file
paths overlap. Unrelated base and session records can proceed independently;
if Git cannot prove the path sets, My AI keeps the existing fail-closed hold.

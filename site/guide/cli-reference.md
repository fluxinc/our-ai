# CLI Reference

Run `my --help` for the authoritative surface. This page groups the current
commands by job.

## Which command do I run?

Three commands sound alike; the split is converge vs. diagnose vs. plumbing:

- **`my sync`** converges the whole workspace. It pulls every registered
  repository (manifest cache, content mounts, catalog repo clones), reconciles
  generated guidance, umbrella MCP config, and launch-scoped skill notices when
  the manifest changed, and never publishes local changes unless the operator
  passes `--push` or an explicit `--publish` mode. This is the one routine verb
  for stale inbound state; use `my sync --push --print` then `my sync --push`
  when local changes should be shared.
- **`my doctor`** is the dry run for installation and workspace repair: it
  diagnoses manifest validity, per-checkout Git freshness, derived
  guidance/MCP drift, legacy global org-skill drift, service materialization
  health, work-session health, and the last sync audit,
  marking every repairable finding with `would ...` and a closing fixable
  count. Nothing changes until you re-run with `--fix`, which applies exactly
  that plan; findings `--fix` cannot repair (dirty, diverged, repo checkouts,
  session work) keep their explanatory remediation text instead.
- **`my manifests sync`** refreshes the registered manifest cache. You need
  it before an umbrella exists (bootstrap) or when managing several
  registered manifests; when exactly one manifest changes and an umbrella is
  known, it also reconciles generated guidance, umbrella MCP config, and
  launch-scoped skill reconciliation notices. Once an umbrella is set up, plain
  `my sync` is still the routine command.

## Setup and launch

```sh
my init <org-id> [--name NAME] [--path DIR] [--umbrella DIR] [--home DIR] [--setup] [--json]
my publish [--manifest NAME] [--home DIR] [--print] [--json]
my onboarding [--agent|--no-agent] [--harness NAME] [--manifest NAME] [--home DIR] [--umbrella DIR] [--no-refresh] [--no-update-check]
my setup [harness...] | --all [--interactive] [--print] [--copy] [--link] [--force] [--verbose] [--role ROLE] [--manifest NAME] [--home DIR] [--umbrella DIR] [--no-refresh] [--no-update-check]
my root [--repo ID] [--manifest NAME] [--home DIR] [--umbrella DIR] [--no-refresh] [--no-update-check]
my ai [--new-session|--session ID|--resume [ID]|--no-session] [--repo ID] [--skills all|none|ID,...] [--profile ID] [--setup] [--print] [--manifest NAME] [--home DIR] [--umbrella DIR] [--no-refresh] [--no-update-check] [harness] [-- harness args...]
my sync [--backend auto|gnit|builtin] [--push|--publish auto|never|direct|pr] [--scope all|local|content|manifest|repos] [--manifest NAME] [--home DIR] [--umbrella DIR] [--message TEXT] [--no-derived] [--print] [--verbose] [--json]
my doctor [--no-fetch] [--fix] [--json]
my update [--check] [--version X.Y.Z] [--json] [--yes]
my version
```

`my init` creates two local repositories — a private manifest repo at the
registry path (the control plane) and a content repo at
`<umbrella>/workspace` (`--path` overrides) — commits and registers them, and
prints manifest-scoped follow-up commands for setup, launch, and publish. Both
repos work offline and report `local-only` until published.

`my onboarding` is the guided first-run path. In an interactive terminal it
launches a harness with the bundled Agent-Operated Onboarding guidance. The
model greets the operator, starts a split-pane learn-by-example walkthrough, and
has the operator run small sets of validated `my` commands with a pause after
each set. A harness is auto-detected when the choice is unambiguous; pass
`--harness NAME` to choose. `--agent` forces the harness path from
non-interactive contexts.

`my onboarding --no-agent` and non-interactive runs use the deterministic
walkthrough: with no registered manifest it prints the
`my manifests add <name> <git-url>` next step and writes no state; with a
manifest it explains the model, offers `my setup --interactive`, and records
tour completion only after setup actually runs. Plain `my setup` remains
non-interactive and scriptable; `--interactive` prompts for manifest and role
selection. `my onboard` remains a compatibility alias.

`my publish` takes the organization online idempotently: it creates private
remotes (`<org>-workspace`, `<org>-manifest`) via `gh`, or adopts existing
origins and pushes (verifying GitHub remotes are private), rewrites local
mount URLs to the published repositories, commits reviewed manifest
control-plane edits under `manifest.json`, `catalog/`, `skills/`, `guidance/`,
and `agent-guidance/`, updates the registry, and prints the teammate join
command.
`my sync` refuses to publish a manifest that still references local mount
paths, and `my doctor` names each such mount with the `my publish`
remediation.

## Governance and experimental access revocation

For employees, governance is part of the normal launch:

```sh
my ai
```

If a required policy is new or changed, `my ai` displays the exact committed
document and asks once for acceptance. A yes records the acceptance, starts its
durable publication, and continues into the AI. A decline or EOF does not
launch. Non-interactive callers fail closed.

Generated `AGENTS.md` carries a role-scoped `## Organization Policies` index
with summaries, topics, and exact `my policy show <id>` read actions. Every
real launch verifies all applicable required and optional policy blobs locally
before writing launch context or executing the harness. `my compile` exposes
the same inventory as digest-bound `policies[]` references and rejects a policy
whose mount is outside the selected role.

Without an explicitly activated access baseline, launch uses a read-only live
GitHub access check. It does not write access state or enable quarantine.
`my root` and `my ai --print` never prompt; they preserve stdout (`my root` is
a path and `my ai --print` is a shell command) and emit a short pending-policy
or pending-access notice on stderr.

```sh
my policy list
my policy show <id> [--json]
my policy status [id] [--json]
my policy accept <id> --yes
my policy acceptances [--json]
```

Employees do not need these commands for routine launch: interactive `my ai`
owns required review and acceptance. Agents use `show` when the generated
consultation contract identifies a covered topic. Never accept on a person's
behalf.

The detailed policy, record, audit, and authoring verbs remain available to
agents and administrative automation. They are intentionally not a human setup
runbook; use `my policy --help`, `my record --help`, `my governance --help`, or
`my admin policy --help` when building those workflows. Acceptance and
supersession evidence are append-only, bound to exact policy bytes and immutable
GitHub user ids, and published through isolated pull requests. CI currently
enforces universal required policies. Role-scoped requirements remain a local
gate until manifests carry authoritative identity-to-role mapping.

```sh
my access check --dry-run
my access activate --yes
my access status
my access monitor install|uninstall|run
```

Automatic quarantine is a separate experimental endpoint-security plane.
Policy and record governance never activate it; activation is an explicit
per-machine action. Quarantine is immediate after revocation is detected and
confirmed, while detection latency is bounded by the monitor interval, the
positive-access TTL, and denial-confirmation count and interval. Ambiguous 404,
SSO, scope, and network results block use after the TTL but never authorize
quarantine. Do not recommend activation for a real umbrella until a drill with
disposable private repositories and a second identity proves lossless recovery,
capsule restore, dirty/untracked/ahead/session handling, and no purge fallback.

## Skills

```sh
my skills self install [harness...] | --all [--home DIR] [--copy] [--link] [--force] [--json]
my skills self uninstall [harness...] | --all [--home DIR] [--force] [--json]
my skills self status [harness...] | --all [--home DIR] [--json]

my skills list [--json] [--source DIR] [--manifest NAME] [--home DIR]
my skills show <id|slug> [--json] [--source DIR] [--manifest NAME] [--home DIR]
my skills status [--skill ID_OR_SLUG] [--json] [--source DIR] [--manifest NAME] [--home DIR]
my skills install [harness...] | --all [--skill ID_OR_SLUG] [--print] [--copy] [--link] [--force] [--source DIR] [--manifest NAME]
my skills uninstall <harness...> | --all [--skill ID_OR_SLUG] [--print] [--force] [--source DIR] [--manifest NAME]
my skills sync [harness...] | --all [--skill ID_OR_SLUG] [--no-prune] [--print] [--copy] [--link] [--force] [--source DIR] [--manifest NAME]
my skills purge <harness...> | --all [--skill ID_OR_SLUG] [--print] [--force] [--source DIR] [--manifest NAME]
```

`--manifest NAME` reads skills from a synced manifest and overrides the
current/default manifest; `--source DIR` reads them from a local directory
instead. With no harness arguments, install targets every supported harness and
silently skips ones that are not present.

## Admin

```sh
my admin skills add <skill-dir> --id namespace:name --manifest-dir DIR [--install-slug SLUG] [--require TYPE:ID] [--keep-original|--remove-original] [--force] [--json]
my admin skills remove <id|slug> --manifest-dir DIR [--delete-source] [--prune-related] [--prune-orphans] [--force] [--json]
my admin setup ...
my admin manifests add|sync|validate ...
my admin mounts add|remove|sync ...
my admin meetings add ...
my admin support add ...
my admin tools add|edit|remove <id> --manifest-dir DIR [--mode required|optional] [--purpose TEXT] [--install-command CMD] [--docs-url URL] [--skill-install-command CMD] [--skill-install-arg ARG] [--force] [--json]
my admin contract add "RULE TEXT" --manifest-dir DIR [--force] [--json]
my admin contract remove <index|"RULE TEXT"> --manifest-dir DIR [--force] [--json]
my admin policy add <id> --title TEXT --mount ID --path PATH --version VERSION --acceptance required|optional [--summary TEXT] [--topic TEXT] [--role ID] [--manifest NAME] [--home DIR] [--umbrella DIR] [--json]
my admin policy add <id> ... --manifest-dir DIR --sha256 sha256:HEX [--force] [--json]
my admin policy remove <id> [--manifest NAME] [--home DIR] [--umbrella DIR] [--json]
```

See the [admin guide](./admin.md) for the full flag set and the
review plus `my publish --manifest NAME` workflow that follows every admin
edit.

## Manifests, mounts, and workspace

`my manifests default [<name>]` shows or repoints the global default manifest
(initially the first one added; `--clear` reverts to it). When `--manifest` is
omitted, commands prefer the current umbrella's manifest, then fall back to this
registry default.

```sh
my manifests add <name> <git-url>
my manifests list
my manifests default [<name>] [--clear] [--home DIR] [--json]
my manifests sync [name...] | --all [--home DIR] [--umbrella DIR] [--no-derived] [--print] [--json]
my manifests validate <name|path>

my mounts list [--manifest NAME] [--home DIR] [--umbrella DIR] [--json]
my mounts add <kind:id|id> [--manifest NAME] [--home DIR] [--umbrella DIR] [--print] [--json]
my mounts sync <mount...> | --all [--manifest NAME] [--home DIR] [--umbrella DIR] [--print] [--json]
my mounts remove <mount...> [--home DIR] [--umbrella DIR] [--print] [--force] [--json]

my workspaces list [--manifest NAME]
my workspaces sync <workspace...> | --all [--manifest NAME] [--print]

my session start [--slug SLUG] [--json] [--print] [harness] [-- harness args...]
my session join <session-id> <harness> [-- harness args...]
my session resume [session-id] [harness] [--json]
my session status [--all] [--json]
my session list [--all] [--json]
my session finish [session-id] --land|--publish|--discard [--message TEXT] [--verbose] [--json]
my session leftovers [--all] [--json]
my session close-worktree <path> [--yes] [--json]

my work start|status|list|resume|finish ...  # deprecated alias of my session
```

With no `--manifest`, commands prefer the manifest recorded by the current
umbrella or `--umbrella DIR`. Outside an umbrella, they use the registry default,
which is the first manifest added unless the registry names another default.

```

Bare `my meetings` and `my support` are aliases for their `list` forms,
including list filters. They do not create records or open interactive menus.

`my sync` is the routine pull/reconcile command. Bare `my sync` never publishes
local changes. `--backend auto` uses Gnit only for exact roster members and the
guarded built-in path for unrostered checkouts; My AI keeps the bootstrap,
policy, duplicate-remote, selected-scope, and PR layers. `my sync --push`
publishes eligible local changes per manifest
policy; `--publish direct` can publish existing local commits directly. For
reviewed manifest control-plane edits, prefer `my publish --manifest NAME`;
`my sync --publish direct --scope manifest` is the equivalent low-level sync
form. Auto `--push` remains content-only, and unrelated dirty files stay held
for explicit admin or review handling. Plain untracked (`??`) files under
content mount paths are also held; create records with `my customers add`,
`my meetings add`, `my support add`, or `my fleet add`, or run
`my record adopt <path>` to mark a manually created file as intentional publish
content. Held-back JSON results include `reason_code` and, where the remedy is
unambiguous, `next_command`; text output shows that command as `next=...` on the
held-back row. A manifest can set top-level
`sync.publish_policy` to `auto`, `never`, or `pr` as the mode for `--push`; an
explicit `--publish` flag always wins. Non-print syncs write
`.my-cli/last-sync.json`; `my doctor`
reports that audit, per-checkout Git freshness, active and archived work
sessions, service health, derived guidance/MCP drift, and legacy global
org-skill drift, and legacy `work/<id>` session directories that can be migrated.
Doctor fetches
refs before behind/ahead checks unless `--no-fetch` is passed for an offline
view. `doctor --fix` fast-forwards only clean stale manifest/content checkouts
and reconciles generated guidance, umbrella `.mcp.json`, legacy global
org-skill cleanup, and active legacy session layout migration. Sync performs
the same derived reconcile after manifest checkout changes unless `--no-derived`
is passed.

`my root`, `my ai`, and `my setup` run a best-effort, TTL-gated
refresh for clean manifest/content checkouts before using workspace context.
They leave dirty, diverged, repo, and remote-unknown checkouts untouched.
`my ai` also ensures the bundled `my-cli` self-skill exists for the selected
filesystem harness before launching it. By default it launches from the base
umbrella, or from the current active session when run inside `sessions/<id>`.
Use `--new-session` to create a fresh isolated session, `--session <id>` or
`-r <id>` to launch into a known active session, `-r <harness>` to select the
only active session or pick one in an interactive terminal, or `--no-session`
to ignore a current session for base inspection/admin/debug. New-session
launches print the session id/path plus `my session join` and finish hints
before exec. Repo launches use `--repo <id>` and are not included in sessions yet. Use `--no-refresh` for
one command, `MYCLI_NO_AUTO_REFRESH=1` globally, or `MYCLI_REFRESH_TTL=30m` to
tune the default six-hour window.

Manifest roles are selected locally with `my setup --role <id>`. The choice
is stored in `.my-cli/state.json`, appends that role's guidance fragments to
`AGENTS.md`, and scopes generated `.mcp.json` to MCP services selected by the
role. Services and roles are manifest vocabulary: inspect them with
`my services list|get` and `my roles list|get`; they do not prune mounts.
`my compile --role <id>` prints the deterministic contained-runner launch
projection JSON for that role without launching containers, resolving
credentials, or fetching service descriptors. Governed projections include
only universal and exact-role `policies[]` references with id, title, version,
digest, mount, path, summary, and topics. Compile fails if an applicable policy
mount is not visible to the role; non-governed projections omit the field.

Those startup commands also emit a stderr-only notice when a newer My AI release
is available. Stdout remains clean for command substitutions such as
`cd "$(my root)"`. The check follows GitHub's public release redirect rather
than the rate-limited REST API. Use `--no-update-check`,
`MYCLI_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`, or `MYCLI_UPDATE_CHECK_TTL=12h` to suppress or tune
that check.

`my update` downloads the selected GitHub release tarball, verifies it against
`checksums.txt`, and atomically replaces the running binary when the install is
writable and not package-managed. Use `my update --check` for a read-only
version comparison, or `my update --version X.Y.Z` to install a specific
release.

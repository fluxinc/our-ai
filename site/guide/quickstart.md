# Quickstart

## Prerequisites

Install Git, `curl`, `tar`, and either `sha256sum` or `shasum`. You also need
at least one supported harness CLI (for example Codex, Claude Code, Grok, or
Cursor) before `my ai` can launch it. The GitHub CLI (`gh`) is needed only when
`my publish` creates repositories or when your normal private-HTTPS Git
authentication uses it.

On Windows, use [WSL](./windows-wsl): install and run the Linux `my` binary,
Git, and your harness inside the same WSL distribution. Keep the umbrella
under `/home/<user>`, not `/mnt/c`, and do not mix Windows Git metadata with
WSL Git.

## Install My AI

Install the latest release:

```sh
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluxinc/my-cli/master/install.sh | sh
```

If the install directory is not on your path, add it:

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Verify the binary:

```sh
my version
my doctor
```

`my doctor` reports manifest validity, generated guidance/MCP drift, legacy
global org-skill drift,
service materialization health, local Git freshness, and the last
`.my-cli/last-sync.json` audit when an umbrella is present. Add `--no-fetch` for
an offline freshness check, or `--fix` to fast-forward clean stale
manifest/content checkouts and reconcile derived guidance, MCP config, and
legacy global org-skill cleanup.

## Choose a manifest path

### Produce a new organization manifest

```sh
my init acme --name "Acme"
my setup --manifest acme
```

`my init` creates two local repositories and registers the organization:

- a **private manifest repo** — the control plane (manifest, catalog, skills,
  agent guidance), kept at the registry path out of the workspace; admins
  change it through `my admin` commands;
- a **content repo** at `~/acme/workspace` — the actual workspace content:
  meetings, support records, fleet records, decisions, policy, people.

Everything works offline immediately and reports `local-only` until you
publish. Move into the generated umbrella and prove it is operational:

```sh
cd "$(my root)"
my doctor
my ai codex
```

When you are ready to share, preview the outward action and review it before
running the real publish:

```sh
my publish --manifest acme --print
my publish --manifest acme
```

The real publish creates the two private GitHub repos (`acme-manifest` and
`acme-workspace`), points the manifest's mount at the published content repo,
pushes both, and prints the join command for teammates. Because the manifest
and the workspace are separate repos, you can restrict manifest pushes to
admins while the whole team pushes content.

### Install an existing organization manifest

If your team already has a manifest repo, register, sync, and materialize it:

```sh
my manifests add acme <git-url>
my manifests sync acme
my setup --manifest acme
cd "$(my root)"
my doctor
my ai codex
```

Private GitHub manifests use your normal Git credentials. For HTTPS private
repos, make sure `gh auth login` (or your usual Git credentials) works before
running `my manifests sync` against a private repo.

## Optional guided onboarding

```sh
my onboarding
# or: my onboarding --no-agent, then my setup
# my setup --manifest acme    # override the current/default manifest
# my setup --role operator    # optional: select role-specific guidance/services
# my setup --interactive      # prompt for manifest/role choices
```

`my onboarding` launches guided onboarding in a harness when run interactively.
Use `my onboarding --no-agent` for the deterministic walkthrough: it explains
the model, offers to run `my setup --interactive`, and if no manifest is
registered yet, prints the `my manifests add <name> <git-url>` next step while
leaving the tour unmarked. Run `my setup` after the deterministic walkthrough
or whenever you want to converge the workspace without an onboarding
conversation.
Plain `my setup` stays deterministic and scriptable. With one registered
manifest, every command defaults to it. Setup is safe to re-run: it validates
the manifest, installs the bundled self-skill, creates the umbrella, writes
generated guidance, and syncs default content. Organization skills are composed
by `my ai` into the launch root. Opted-in catalog repo clones live under
`repos/<id>` in the umbrella.

## Operate from the umbrella

```sh
my ai codex
```

That's it: `my ai` verifies generated guidance and launches the harness from
the base umbrella. For isolated content work, use `my ai --new-session codex`
or create one with `my session start codex`; use
`my session join <id> claude-code` to add another harness to the same session.
When the work is done, `my session finish --land | --publish | --discard` is
how it leaves the session. Pass `--session <id>` or `-r <id>` to launch into a
known active session, or `-r codex` to select the only active session or pick
one in an interactive terminal. Use
`--no-session` to ignore a current session for base inspection or admin,
`--print` to see the command without executing it, or `--setup` to reconcile
the umbrella first. Use `my session status` or `my session list` to inspect active
sessions; `my doctor` also reports session health.

Harnesses sometimes create raw Git worktrees outside My AI's session registry.
Before reporting repository work complete, inspect them:

```sh
my session leftovers
my session close-worktree <exact-listed-path> --yes
```

The close command only accepts an inventoried, clean, unlocked, named-branch
leftover. It uses ordinary non-force Git removal and preserves the branch.
Dirty, detached, missing, locked, base, and active-session worktrees are
reported with instructions and left untouched.

At startup, `my root`, `my ai`, and `my setup` print stderr-only `notice`
lines for checkouts auto-refresh cannot converge (dirty, ahead, behind, or
diverged), each naming the repository and the command to run, such as
`my sync` or `my doctor`. Stdout stays clean, so `cd "$(my root)"` is safe.

## Update my

Use the self-update command:

```sh
my update --check
my update
```

`my update` downloads the latest GitHub release, verifies the checksum, and
replaces the local binary. It refuses package-managed or non-writable installs
and prints the right follow-up command.

Re-running the installer still works as a fallback:

```sh
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluxinc/my-cli/master/install.sh | sh
```

The installer also refreshes the bundled `my-cli` self-skill in existing harnesses
so agents keep current CLI guidance.

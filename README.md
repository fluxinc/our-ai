# my

`my` is a small, dependency-free CLI that bootstraps an AI agent's working
environment from a single organization manifest. One command turns a fresh
machine into one where installed AI harnesses — Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode,
Antigravity, Grok, and Cursor — share the same company context,
manifest-defined launch profiles, and local tooling.

It is built for a world where **agents are the primary operators**. Humans own
intent — goals, products, decisions — and express it as content in a Git repo.
`my` is the deterministic, machine-friendly bridge that gets that content and
those capabilities onto every agent surface, the same way, every time.

Documentation: https://my-cli.com/

Prerequisites: Git, `curl`, `tar`, and either `sha256sum` or `shasum`, plus one
installed and authenticated agent harness. Install the agent first so it can
guide the rest of first-machine setup. The GitHub CLI (`gh`, logged in) is
required for any manifest or mount hosted on github.com and when `my publish`
creates repositories; the installer and `my doctor` report it, and the guide
checks it before attempting private Git operations. Windows users should
run the Linux CLI and Git together inside
[WSL](https://my-cli.com/guide/windows-wsl), with the umbrella under the WSL
home directory.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://my-cli.com/install.sh | sh
```

On a fresh interactive install, that command installs the release binary,
persists `~/.local/bin` in the shell profile, installs the bundled agent skill,
and starts guided onboarding. It does not require Go or Node. For CI or an
automation-only install, add `--no-onboarding` after `sh -s --`.

An organization can give a new teammate one complete bootstrap command:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://my-cli.com/install.sh | sh -s -- --manifest acme <manifest-git-url>
```

The agent resumes from whatever is missing: GitHub CLI installation/login,
manifest sync, setup, role selection, required organization tools, verification,
and first launch. An authenticated `gh` session is supplied to HTTPS Git only
for the current invocation; My AI does not rewrite global Git configuration.
Creating a new organization remains a guided `my init` path. `my onboarding`
can be rerun at any point and starts a split-pane walkthrough where the operator
runs small sets of validated `my` commands while the model explains and pauses.
Use `my onboarding --no-agent` for the deterministic walkthrough that explains
the model and points at `my setup --interactive`. `my setup` remains the
scriptable machine configurator. `my ai codex` resolves the umbrella, verifies
the generated guidance, and starts Codex in the base umbrella. Agents that need
isolated content work opt in with `my ai --new-session codex` or resume a known
session with `my ai -r <id> codex`.

`my init` creates two local repos — a private manifest repo (the control
plane: manifest, product/repo catalog, skills) and a content repo at
`~/acme/workspace` (the actual workspace, including customer records) —
registers them, and works offline. When ready to
share, `my publish` creates the private remotes, points the manifest at the
published content repo, and pushes both; teammates join with a single
`my manifests add acme <manifest-url>`.
Run `my update` to update an install from the latest GitHub release; re-running
`install.sh` still works as a fallback. Developers can still install from source
with `go install github.com/fluxinc/my-cli/cmd/my@latest`, but Go is not a user
installation prerequisite. The installer also
installs My AI's bundled `my-cli` skill into existing harnesses
so agents know how to use the CLI itself.

## The Model

`my` has eight concepts. Everything in the CLI is one of these:

| Concept | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Manifest** | An organization's configuration, stored in its own private Git repo — the control plane. Declares skills, mounts, data bindings, catalog, services, roles, and tool hints. The single source of truth; it is not the workspace, and day-to-day work never touches it. |
| **Skill** | A capability exposed to harnesses. *Organization* skills are *static* (a directory in the manifest repo) or *tool-provided* (materialized by an external tool's own installer); `my ai` composes them into the launch root for harnesses with a project-local skill seam. The CLI also ships one public, organization-neutral *self-skill* named `my-cli`, embedded in the binary, that teaches harnesses how to use `my` itself. |
| **Umbrella** | A per-user operating envelope (e.g. `~/acme`): a `.my-cli/` identity namespace plus mounts and local scratch as peers. When initialized for sync publishing, this is the Gnit control workspace so multi-repo commits and pushes have one substrate. |
| **Mount** | A Git-backed content folder cloned into the umbrella (handbook, customers, meeting notes, policy, docs). Can be path-scoped so only the relevant subtree lands. |
| **Session** | An isolated unit of work under `sessions/<id>`: a git worktree per content mount on a fresh `my/session/<id>` branch, plus session-local scratch and generated guidance with concrete startup context. Create one with `my session start` or `my ai --new-session`; add another harness with `my session join <id> <harness>`; inspect it with `my session status` or `my session list`; work leaves only through `my session finish --land\|--publish\|--discard`. |
| **Catalog** | JSON inventories for products (business entities, which may link repos) and repos (the organization's repositories). Users opt specific repos into their umbrella on demand. Customer identities are mounted workspace records, not manifest catalog rows. |
| **Guidance** | Generated root `AGENTS.md` instructions for agents, built from a public baseline plus manifest-declared and role-specific fragments. `CLAUDE.md` points to the same file. |
| **Tool** | An external executable the org depends on. `my` reports presence and install hints — it never silently installs tools. |

Skills arrive from two places, split by a public/private line. The `my-cli`
self-skill is **public** and travels **inside the CLI binary** — it is
organization-neutral, carries no company content, and the binary keeps it
current on its own. **Organization skills** are **private** to a manifest repo
you control and appear only once you add and sync that manifest, so they can
carry guidance specific to your team. Nothing organization-specific is ever
baked into the public CLI.

## Commands

Run `my --help` for the authoritative surface. The essentials:

### Onboarding

```sh
my onboarding [--harness codex]
                               # model-driven onboarding; auto-detects a harness when unambiguous
my onboarding --no-agent       # deterministic walkthrough; offers interactive setup
my setup [harness...] | --all # create umbrella, write guidance/MCP config, install self-skill, sync mounts
                                    # [--manifest NAME] [--umbrella DIR] [--role ROLE] [--copy] [--link] [--print]
                                    # [--interactive] [--no-refresh] [--no-update-check]
```

`setup` is the normal machine path: idempotent, non-interactive, safe to
re-run. Use `setup --interactive` when you want prompts for manifest and role
selection. Use `my onboarding` when you want a harness to run the adaptive
AUTHOR/JOIN onboarding flow; `my onboard` remains a compatibility alias.
Publish still requires `my publish --print` and explicit human approval.

### Startup

```sh
my root [--repo ID] [--no-refresh] [--no-update-check]
                                             # print the umbrella or repo path
my ai [--new-session|--session ID|--resume [ID]|--no-session] [--repo ID] [--skills all|none|ID,...] [--profile ID] [--setup] [--no-refresh] [--no-update-check] [harness]
                                             # verify guidance, then start a harness
my ai codex --model gpt-5              # pass harness flags after the harness name
my ai --new-session codex
my ai --session 2026-06-11-ab12 codex
my ai -r codex                         # resume the only active session, or pick in a TTY
my ai -r 2026-06-11-ab12 codex
my ai --repo sample-service codex
my ai --print codex                    # print cd <umbrella> && codex
my session leftovers                   # raw worktrees not owned by an active session
my session close-worktree <path> --yes # close a clean leftover; preserve its branch
```

`ai` refuses to start against missing or stale generated guidance. Pass
`--setup` to reconcile first, or run `my setup` directly. By default it
launches from the base umbrella, or from the current active session when
run inside `sessions/<id>`. Use `--new-session` to create a fresh isolated
session, `--session` or `-r <id>` to launch into a known active session,
`-r <harness>` to resume the single active session or pick one interactively,
and `--no-session` to ignore a current session for base inspection/admin/debug.
`root`, `ai`, and `setup` also run a best-effort, TTL-gated refresh of
clean manifest/content checkouts so startup sees current context without
touching dirty, diverged, repo, or remote-unknown checkouts. Use
`--no-refresh` for one command, `MYCLI_NO_AUTO_REFRESH=1` globally, or
`MYCLI_REFRESH_TTL=30m` to tune the default six-hour refresh window.

Startup commands also print stderr `notice` lines for dirty, ahead, behind, or
diverged checkouts, each with the remediation command, keeping stdout clean.
They additionally check, at most once per day, whether a newer My AI
release exists, using GitHub's public release redirect rather than the
rate-limited REST API. Notices are stderr-only so `cd "$(my root)"` stays
path-pure.
Use `--no-update-check` for one command, `MYCLI_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` globally, or
`MYCLI_UPDATE_CHECK_TTL=12h` to tune the check window.

### Updating My AI

```sh
my update --check                  # compare this binary with the latest release
my update                          # download, verify, and replace this binary
my update --version 0.5.0          # install a specific release
```

`my update` verifies the release tarball against `checksums.txt` before
replacing the binary. It refuses package-managed or non-writable installs and
prints the matching follow-up, such as `brew upgrade my`,
`go install github.com/fluxinc/my-cli/cmd/my@latest`, or re-running
`install.sh`.

### Manifests

```sh
my init <org-id> [--name NAME] [--path DIR] # create manifest + content repos locally
my publish [--manifest NAME] [--print]      # publish remotes and reviewed manifest control-plane edits
my manifests add <name> <git-url>          # register an org manifest
my manifests sync [name...] | --all        # refresh checkout and derived artifacts
my manifests list                          # list registered manifests
my manifests validate <name|path>          # schema + reference checks
```

When `--manifest` is omitted, `my` uses the manifest recorded by the current
umbrella (or `--umbrella DIR`) first. Outside an umbrella it uses the registry
default, which is initialized to the first manifest you add. `my manifests list`
marks that default.

When a non-print manifest sync pulls or clones exactly one manifest, `my`
reconciles derived workspace artifacts for an existing matching umbrella:
generated guidance, umbrella MCP config, and launch-scoped skill reconciliation
notices. Pass
`--no-derived` for a cache-only refresh or `--umbrella DIR` when the intended
umbrella is not the current one.

### Services and roles

```sh
my services list [--json]
my services get <id> [--json]
my roles list [--json]
my roles get <id> [--json]
my admin services add|edit|remove ...
my admin roles add|edit|remove ...
my setup --role operator
my compile --role operator [--manifest NAME] [--home DIR]
```

Manifest `data_bindings` map stable data nouns (`customers`, `meetings`,
`support`, `fleet`) to an existing `mount:<id>` or `service:<id>`.
Manifest `services` describe remote organization surfaces such as HTTP APIs and
MCP servers. Manifest `roles` are local loadouts: they select services and
optional role-specific guidance without granting authority or pruning mounts.
`my setup --role <id>` stores the local role selection in `.my-cli/state.json`,
appends that role's guidance fragments to `AGENTS.md`, and materializes
umbrella-root `.mcp.json` for locally described MCP services visible to the
role. `my compile --role <id>` is the read-only Mode B handoff: it prints a
deterministic manifest-to-Clawdapus launch projection as JSON, without
launching containers or resolving credentials. A role is required when the
manifest declares roles; manifests with no roles compile unscoped. Governed
projections include universal plus exact-role `policies[]` references and fail
if an applicable policy mount is outside the selected role.

### Contract rules

```sh
my contract list [--json]
my admin contract add "RULE TEXT" [--manifest <name>] [--umbrella <root>]
my admin contract remove <index|"RULE TEXT"> [--manifest <name>] [--umbrella <root>]
```

Manifest `contract` entries are short, binding organization rules rendered
into generated `AGENTS.md`. Reads stay top-level; edits go through the admin
review flow. The registered-manifest form resolves the current umbrella and
opens an isolated governed pull request without dirtying the sync-managed
manifest cache. `--manifest-dir <checkout>` remains available for maintainers
who intentionally want a local-only edit followed by `my publish --manifest`.

### Skills

```sh
my skills self status [--json]            # installed/absent status for the bundled my-cli skill
my skills self install [harness...] | --all
my skills list [--json]                   # manifest/source skills available to install
my skills show <id|slug> [--json]         # one skill's metadata and source path
my skills status [--skill ID_OR_SLUG]     # installed/absent status across harnesses
my skills install [harness...] | --all    # explicit user-global materialization
my skills uninstall <harness...> | --all  # remove materialized skills
my skills sync [harness...] | --all       # install/update and prune stale My AI-managed skills
my skills purge <harness...> | --all      # remove My AI-managed materializations
```

`my skills self ...` manages the bundled, public-safe `my-cli` CLI skill. It is
installed by `install.sh`, refreshed during `my setup`, ensured for the
selected filesystem harness before `my ai` execs it, and quietly kept current
for already-installed file-based harness copies when a newer binary runs.

Use `--skill ID_OR_SLUG` on manifest skill `install`, `uninstall`, `sync`,
`purge`, or `status` to target a single declared skill. These commands are
explicit manual user-global materialization surfaces; managed launches get
organization skills from `my ai` in the launch root when the harness supports
that. OpenCode is currently compatibility-global: present or explicit OpenCode
setup/launch keeps org skills in `~/.config/opencode/skills`, and `my ai
opencode --skills/--profile` is rejected until OpenCode has a proven
project-local seam. Manual manifest skills install as symlinks by default
(`--copy` to vendor a copy). `my` records provenance and refuses to clobber a
directory it did not place. `skills sync` prunes stale My AI-managed manual
manifest skills by default, but does not remove the bundled `my-cli` self-skill;
pass `--no-prune` to only install/update. Skill commands only refresh harness
skill directories; run `my setup` when manifest guidance or the generated
umbrella `AGENTS.md` should change without a manifest sync.

Organization skill source directories are immutable. Mutable credentials,
cookies, caches, and downloads belong under
`~/.local/state/my-cli/skills/<manifest>/<install-slug>/`. `my doctor` warns
about unexpected files under every declared skill source, and publish/sync
holds unadopted skill-source files unless a reviewed source change was staged.

Manifest authoring is explicit admin work:

```sh
my admin skills add <skill-dir> --id org:name --manifest-dir <checkout> [--require TYPE:ID]
my admin skills remove <id|slug> --manifest-dir <checkout> [--prune-orphans]
my admin tools add <id> --manifest-dir <checkout> --mode required|optional --purpose "..."
my admin tools edit <id> --manifest-dir <checkout> [--purpose "..."]
my admin tools remove <id> --manifest-dir <checkout>
my admin repos add <id> --manifest-dir <checkout> --git-url <url> [--description "..."] [--default]
my admin services add <id> --manifest-dir <checkout> --kind http|mcp --purpose "..." --auth-ref REF
my admin services edit <id> --manifest-dir <checkout> [--purpose "..."]
my admin services remove <id> --manifest-dir <checkout> [--prune-roles]
my admin roles add <id> --manifest-dir <checkout> --purpose "..."
my admin roles edit <id> --manifest-dir <checkout> [--purpose "..."]
my admin roles remove <id> --manifest-dir <checkout>
my admin contract add "RULE TEXT" [--manifest <name>] [--umbrella <root>]
my admin contract remove <index|"RULE TEXT"> [--manifest <name>] [--umbrella <root>]
my admin policy add <id> --title TEXT --mount ID --path PATH --version VERSION \
  --acceptance required|optional [--summary TEXT] [--topic TEXT] [--role ID]
my admin policy remove <id> [--manifest <name>] [--umbrella <root>]
```

Admin commands other than registered contract and policy authoring write a
maintainer checkout, not the synced cache. Those commands refuse dirty git checkouts
unless `--force` is supplied, never commit or push, and require explicit flags
for duplicate-prone or destructive cleanup such as
`--keep-original`, `--remove-original`, `--delete-source`, or product
`related_skills` pruning. Removing a skill reports now-orphaned tools and
allowed namespaces; `--prune-orphans` removes those too. Tool removal refuses
manifest skills that still reference the tool. After a write they print the
relevant `git status` and `git diff` follow-up commands.

`my admin` is the home for shared/workspace configuration. Mutating or
configuration commands are reachable there too, with the top-level forms
retained as quiet compatibility aliases:

```sh
my admin setup ...                 # alias of my setup
my admin manifests add|sync|validate  # alias of my manifests ...
my admin mounts add|remove|sync       # alias of my mounts ...
my admin meetings add                # alias of my meetings add
my admin support add                 # alias of my support add
my admin tools add|edit|remove       # edit manifest tools[]
my admin repos add                   # edit catalog/repos.json
my admin contract add|remove         # edit manifest contract[]
```

Admin aliases are intentionally limited to those mutating/configuration
subcommands. Operational reads (`list`/`show`/`status`/`search`/`get`) stay
under their top-level commands.

### Umbrella mounts

```sh
my mounts list                             # manifest content mounts
my mounts add <kind:id|id>                 # opt an optional content mount in
my mounts sync <mount...> | --all          # clone or fast-forward mounts
my mounts remove <mount...> [--force]
```

Repo clones are managed with `my repos add <id>` and land under `repos/<id>`
in the umbrella; legacy `products/` checkouts migrate automatically at
`my setup`.

### Sync

```sh
my sync                                   # pull/reconcile only; never publishes local changes
my sync --print                           # plan the pull-only default
my sync --push --print                    # preview explicit publish work
my sync --push                            # publish eligible local changes per policy
my sync --publish auto|never|direct|pr    # governed organizations force PR mode
my sync --scope all|local|content|manifest|repos  # limit to one repo class; repos = catalog repo clones
my sync --no-derived                      # skip derived guidance/MCP/skill reconcile after manifest changes
```

`my sync` is the routine reconciliation command. Bare `my sync` pulls inbound
updates and never publishes local changes. Use `my sync --push` to publish
eligible local changes according to the manifest policy, or `--publish` to
choose an explicit mode. My AI classifies changes, handles private/public and
content/admin policy, and blocks duplicate checkouts of the same remote until
they are collapsed to one canonical checkout. Exact Gnit roster members use
coordinated multi-repo Change creation, ordered push, and resume; unrostered
checkouts use My AI's guarded built-in publisher. A partial Gnit migration does
not change unrelated checkout behavior, and a scoped My AI publish never
delegates when Gnit would also publish an unselected member. `--backend` remains
an expert diagnostic escape hatch, not part of the employee workflow.
`--publish direct` can publish existing local commits directly in an
ungoverned organization. Governed organizations refuse direct publication and
route outbound changes through a dedicated branch and pull request. Before the
branch is pushed, the CLI builds the prospective commit with a temporary Git
index and runs the same trusted-base governance validator used in CI. After it
proves both the remote branch and the pull request author's immutable GitHub
id, it attaches the checkout to the dedicated topic branch without changing
working-tree bytes and restores the local protected base ref to its proven
upstream commit. Ignored and unrelated local files remain in place. Optional auto-merge
is requested only when `sync.pull_request_auto_merge` is true, and GitHub's
required checks and reviews still gate the merge. For reviewed
manifest control-plane edits under `manifest.json`, `catalog/`, `skills/`,
`guidance/`, and `agent-guidance/`, prefer `my publish --manifest NAME`; the
equivalent low-level sync form is `my sync --publish direct --scope manifest`.
Default `--push` remains policy-driven, auto mode is still content-only, and
unrelated dirty files stay held.
Held-back rows carry `reason_code` and, when the next step is unambiguous,
`next_command`; text output prints that as `next=...`. Dirty-behind checkouts
point first at the local status command, diverged checkouts point at
`my doctor`, and clean behind checkouts point at `my sync`.
A manifest can set top-level `sync.publish_policy` to `auto`, `never`, or `pr`
as the mode for `--push`. Governed manifests always select `pr` for outbound
sync and reject an explicit `direct` override. Set
`sync.pull_request_auto_merge` only when auto-merge after required checks and
human approvals is intended. Non-print
syncs write `.my-cli/last-sync.json` so `my doctor` can show the last sync/publish audit.
When sync pulls or publishes a manifest checkout, it reconciles generated
guidance, umbrella MCP config, and launch-scoped skill reconciliation notices
unless `--no-derived` is passed.

Governed organizations keep the human interaction inside the ordinary product
surface. An employee runs `my ai`. If a required policy is new or changed, the
CLI displays the exact committed document, asks whether it is accepted, records
the answer, starts durable publication of the evidence, and then launches the
AI. Declining or reaching EOF leaves the policy unaccepted and does not launch.
Non-interactive callers fail closed so an agent or harness cannot silently
accept for a person.

Generated guidance gives every launched agent a compact, role-scoped
`## Organization Policies` index: title, id, version, summary, consultation
topics, and the exact digest-verifying `my policy show <id>` action. Policy text
is authoritative over summaries and other guidance. Before every real launch,
`my ai` locally verifies every applicable required or optional committed policy
blob before writing launch context or executing the harness.

The same launch performs a read-only live GitHub access check when the optional
revocation system has not been activated. That check writes no baseline and
does not install or enable a monitor. `my root` and `my ai --print` never prompt
or pollute command output; they put a short policy/access notice on stderr and
leave policy review to the next ordinary `my ai` launch.

Policy setup, inspection, publication recovery, supersession, and GitHub audits
remain available as agent/admin automation under `my policy`, `my admin policy`,
`my record`, and `my governance`. They are implementation controls, not an
employee onboarding checklist. Acceptance and supersession evidence are
append-only and bound to exact committed document bytes and an immutable GitHub
user id. Restoring a superseded acceptance requires a new policy version.
Acceptance publication deliberately does not refresh the manifest-freshness
TTL: its manifest commit is provenance, and every later governed operation
must independently pass its own manifest freshness gate.
Registered policy authoring proposes an isolated manifest
pull request without modifying the sync-managed cache. `add` fetches the policy
mount and hashes the committed upstream blob, never dirty working-tree bytes.
The compatibility `--manifest-dir` path requires an explicit `--sha256` because
it has no registered mounted-policy context.
CI builds `my` from an explicitly configured 40-character trusted commit and
runs `my governance check` against every commit-parent edge in the complete
proposal history and reads its protections only from the trusted manifest base
revision. CI enforces universally required policies; role-scoped requirements
remain local until the manifest has authoritative identity-to-role mapping.
See `examples/governance/` for the pinned base-owned workflow,
CODEOWNERS pattern, ruleset baseline, and immutable PR-author inputs.

Governed manifests can also opt generic additive records into exact mount paths:

```json
{
  "governance": {
    "record_domains": [
      {
        "id": "decisions",
        "title": "Decisions",
        "mount": "handbook",
        "path": "decisions",
        "retention": "no-delete",
        "admin_override": true,
        "review": "codeowner",
        "publish": "auto-pr"
      }
    ],
    "change_record_rules": [
      {
        "mount": "handbook",
        "paths": ["projects"],
        "record_domain": "decisions"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

```sh
my record domains
my record add decisions choose-safe-default --source git:OWNER/REPO@SHA
my record list decisions
my record get decisions 2026-07-17-choose-safe-default
my record outbox
my record reconcile
my record flush [--include-manual]
my sync --push --record decisions/2026-07-17-choose-safe-default
```

`add` durably creates an intent-to-add Markdown record, then appends a local
queue event before trying publication. `auto-pr` submits through the governed
PR path immediately; `manual-pr` waits for an explicit flush with
`--include-manual`. Offline, access, review-policy, or provider failures append
an `attempt-failed` event and leave the record in place. Reconciliation can
rebuild a missing queue item from unpublished Git state after a crash. A
verified remote branch and PR move an item to `submitted`, not `merged`; the
outbox never claims repository acceptance prematurely and never copies record
content outside its governed mount.
When `change_record_rules` covers a source path, `my sync --record` writes a
`My-Record: <domain>/<id>` trailer into the proposed commit. CI uses the
authoritative pull-request number and accepts the source change only after the
named record is merged and reciprocally cites
`github-pr:<owner>/<repository>#<number>` in `sources`.

### Experimental access-revocation plane

Repository access enforcement and automatic quarantine are endpoint-security
mechanisms with a separate activation and release gate from policy acceptance
and linked records:

```sh
my access check --dry-run
my access activate --yes
my access status
my access monitor install|uninstall|run
```

Policy or record dogfood never activates this plane. `my access activate --yes`
is an explicit per-machine action that records positive baselines before the
monitor can quarantine anything. "Immediate" quarantine means immediately
after revocation is detected and positively confirmed; detection itself is not
instantaneous and is bounded by the monitor interval, the positive-access TTL,
and the configured denial-confirmation count and interval. Ambiguous provider
results such as 404, SSO, scope, or network failures block use after the TTL but
do not authorize quarantine.

Do not recommend activation for a real umbrella until a separate drill passes
against disposable private repositories with a second identity. The drill must
prove dirty, untracked, ahead-of-upstream, and active-session recovery; repeated
denial handling; lossless quarantine; recovery-capsule restore; and that no
path ever falls back to purge or recursive deletion.

### Catalog and customer records

```sh
my products list [--json]         # the org's product inventory
my customers list [--json]        # mounted customer identity records
my customers add  <domain|slug> [--name TEXT] [--domain DOMAIN]
                     [--domain-confirmed] [--alias TEXT] [--partner ID]
```

### Meeting notes

```sh
my meetings list   [--since DATE] [--customer ID] [--partner ID] [--product ID] [--json]
my meetings search <text> [--customer ID] [--partner ID] [--product ID] [--json]
my meetings get    <id|path> [--json]
my meetings add    <slug> [--date DATE] [--title TEXT] [--customer ID]
                     [--attendees NAME] [--partner ID] [--source-id ID]
```

Bare `my meetings` performs the same safe list action and accepts list filters.

A markdown-first operational record (YAML frontmatter), resolved against the
umbrella by default, including the configured umbrella from the registered
manifest when the command is run outside the umbrella. Search uses `qmd` when it
is present and falls back to built-in token-AND markdown search.

### Support records

```sh
my support list   [--since DATE] [--customer ID] [--product ID] [--area TEXT] [--tag TEXT] [--feature-candidate] [--json]
my support search <text> [--customer ID] [--product ID] [--area TEXT] [--tag TEXT] [--feature-candidate] [--json]
my support get    <id|path> [--json]
my support add    <slug> [--date DATE] [--title TEXT] [--customer ID]
                    [--product ID] [--area TEXT] [--tag TEXT]
                    [--status open|workaround|resolved] [--feature-candidate]
                    [--print] [--json]
```

Bare `my support` performs the same safe list action and accepts list filters.

An anonymized problem-solving record under `support/`. Use optional canonical
customer IDs in frontmatter when recurrence evidence matters, and keep the body
free of identifying details. Search uses `qmd` when present and falls back to
built-in token-AND markdown search.

### Fleet registry

```sh
my fleet list   [--status TEXT] [--customer ID] [--partner ID] [--identifier ID]
                  [--branch NAME] [--where KEY=VALUE] [--json]
my fleet search <text> [same filters] [--json]
my fleet get    <id|identifier|path> [--json]
my fleet add    <id> [--customer ID] [--partner ID] [--status TEXT]
                  [--device TEXT] [--serial TEXT] [--identifier ID]
                  [--config-repo NAME] [--config-branch NAME]
                  [--deployed-site TEXT] [--ship-to TEXT] [--contact TEXT]
                  [--install-date DATE] [--print] [--json]
my fleet set    <id|identifier> KEY=VALUE... [--json]
```

A registry record per deployed instance under `fleet/<id>.md`, keyed by a
stable id (hostname or node name) and updated in place. `get` resolves any
entry in the record's `identifiers` list — a sales order, functional location,
or serial — and lists support records sharing an identifier. `set` updates
scalar frontmatter fields while preserving everything else, and suggests an
`my sync --push --message` command so workflow transitions stay readable in git
history. The status vocabulary is organization-defined.

### Diagnostics

```sh
my tools list                             # declared tools across selected manifests
my tools info <name>                      # install hints for a declared tool
my doctor [--no-fetch] [--fix]            # git freshness, sessions, services, derived drift, last sync, manifests, tools
```

Data-returning commands expose `--json` where shown. Structured errors use a
machine-readable `{error, message, remediation}` with a concrete next command,
so an agent that hits a wall can recover without a human.
`my doctor` fetches refs before reporting behind/ahead counts by default; use
`--no-fetch` for an offline view labeled as of the last fetch. It also reports
service materialization health, active work sessions, missing session
worktrees, unregistered leftover worktrees, and archived session counts.
`--fix` only fast-forwards clean stale
manifest/content checkouts and reconciles derived guidance, MCP config, and
skills; dirty, diverged, repo, remote-unknown checkouts, and session work are
reported rather than touched. It never removes, prunes, merges, or force-cleans
worktrees. Use `my session leftovers` for exact path-bound remediation.
Sync also prints a non-blocking informational row when a content-mount
leftover has commits absent from its base checkout; it never turns that row
into a pull or publish hold.

## Supported Harnesses

| Harness | Install path |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/<skill>` |
| Codex | `~/.codex/skills/<skill>` |
| OpenCode | `~/.config/opencode/skills/<skill>` |
| Antigravity | `~/.agents/skills/<skill>` |
| Grok | `~/.grok/skills/<skill>` |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/skills/<skill>` |

Managed org-skill launches use the project-local seam where available: Claude
Code receives a launch-root `.claude/skills` mirror, Grok receives a launch-root
`.grok/skills` mirror, Codex and Antigravity read launch-root `.agents/skills`,
Cursor also reads launch-root `.agents/skills`, and OpenCode stays on its global
path as a compatibility exception.

Missing harnesses are skipped silently — `my` configures what is present and
never fails because a harness is absent.

## The Toolchain Around `my`

`my` is the organization layer of a broader agentic toolchain. Each piece is
its own project with one job, and they compose without depending on each
other's internals:

- **`my` (this repo)** — org tooling, primarily for agents: the manifest
  defines the organization; umbrellas and workspaces materialize it so humans
  and AI operators work from the same context with the same commands.
- **[gnit](https://github.com/mostlydev/gnit)** — git-native multi-repo
  workspaces. The umbrella's publish substrate for mounts: cross-repo
  changes, ordered push, reproducible pins.
- **[clawdapus](https://github.com/mostlydev/clawdapus)** — materialization:
  governed agent containers ("claws") compiled from declarative pod files.
  The compile target for turning manifest roles into contained fleet agents,
  with the `my` CLI inside as a governed work surface.
- **cllama** (part of clawdapus) — containment: the governance proxy that
  holds real provider credentials and mediates every model and tool call.
  Agents get scoped bearer tokens, never keys.
- **Policy and audit** sit behind that proxy: behavioral rules compiled from
  the organization's manifest, enforced outside the agent process, with every
  intervention auditable.
- **Gated organization services** — credential brokers and human-reviewed
  communication pipelines — are declared in the manifest and consumed
  identically by human and AI operators: gating is a property of the service,
  not of who is asking.

The shared design principle: external, inward-facing mechanisms (directories,
mounts, proxies, repos) govern agents at boundaries they cannot avoid — never
through any harness's internal machinery.

## Public/Private Boundary

**This repository is the generic mechanism and is public-safe. It must never
contain organization content.**

- **`my` (this repo, public)** — the CLI: onboarding, manifest, skill,
  mount, catalog, and meeting mechanics. Generic. No customer data, no
  proprietary skills, no internal strategy.
- **`<org>-manifest` (private, control plane)** — the org's definition layer:
  `manifest.json`, proprietary skills, product/repo catalog JSON, tool
  declarations, and agent guidance fragments. Admin-writable.
- **`<org>-workspace` (private, data plane)** — the org's operating content:
  customers, meetings, support, fleet, decisions, policy, projects, people.
  Pushed by the whole organization.

The manifest repo stays outside the umbrella entirely; the workspace a user
or agent browses is a mount of the content repositories the manifest defines.
See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full design
rationale.

## Roadmap

`my` is pre-alpha and evolving quickly. The phases, with detailed plans
indexed in [docs/plans/](docs/plans/README.md):

- **Active — one-command, agent-guided first-machine bootstrap.** A stable
  `https://my-cli.com/install.sh` entrypoint installs the release without Go,
  persists the user-local binary path, optionally registers an existing private
  manifest in the same command, and hands fresh interactive installs to an
  already-installed agent. Registered-but-unsynced manifests are now a
  resumable JOIN state; the guide walks GitHub authentication, setup, and
  required organization tools one issue at a time. GitHub HTTPS Git commands
  use the authenticated `gh` credential helper per invocation without global
  Git configuration changes, never prompt for passwords, and explain
  authentication failures. `my setup` and `my onboarding --no-agent` clone a
  registered-but-unsynced manifest themselves, and `my doctor` gains a
  `prereq` section (git, `gh` login, PATH, harness). Proven end to end on clean
  containers. Plan:
  [first-run bootstrap](docs/plans/2026-08-21-first-run-bootstrap.md).

- **Shipped (v0.39.0) — leftover worktree detection and complete first
  run.** `my session leftovers` and doctor now find raw harness-created
  worktrees through Git porcelain across content mounts and retained catalog
  clones. `close-worktree` can explicitly remove only a clean, named-branch
  leftover while preserving its branch; My AI never auto-prunes, force-removes,
  merges, or deletes it. Public Quickstart now covers prerequisites, WSL, both
  manifest creation and existing-manifest registration, setup, first launch,
  sessions, and publication. Plan: [worktree leak detection and first run](docs/plans/2026-08-14-worktree-leak-detection.md).

- **Shipped (v0.38.0) — Grok and Cursor CLI harnesses.** Grok and Cursor
  remain distinct products and are integrated as distinct harnesses: both read
  generated `AGENTS.md`, receive launch-scoped organization skills through
  their proven project seams, support onboarding and My AI sessions, and get
  the bundled `my-cli` self-skill in their native user skill directories.
  Cursor launch resolution avoids the shared `agent` executable collision.
  Plan: [Grok and Cursor harness integration](docs/plans/2026-08-13-grok-cursor-harness-integration.md).

- **Shipped (v0.37.0, beta) — governed organizations.** The reviewed security core includes:
  provider-backed authorization, lossless revocation quarantine, digest-bound
  policy acceptance, launch gates, PR-only publication, trusted-base CI, and
  live GitHub enforcement audits. Manifest-routed generic records and the
  retryable publication outbox are hardened, and policy attestations now keep
  manifest commits as provenance without racing unrelated manifest advances.
  Acceptance evidence now has isolated durable PR publication,
  local/submitted/merge-proven reporting, trusted-branch CI enforcement for
  universal policies, and append-only administrative supersession.
  Umbrella-root contract authoring now proposes isolated manifest PRs without
  dirtying the sync-managed cache. Reciprocal linked-record CI is implemented.
  The documentation truth pass is complete: automatic revocation quarantine is
  explicitly an experimental endpoint-security plane with separate activation
  and real-world drill gates. Policy/record dogfood does not activate it.
  The final operator-package review also closed the original policy-authoring
  gap with digest-safe isolated policy proposals. A subsequent product review
  restored the intended human surface: employees use `my ai`, which handles
  exact-document policy review and acceptance inline; the detailed governance
  verbs remain agent/admin plumbing. Repeated live authorization work is now
  collapsed inside each launch to one actor lookup and one bounded-concurrent
  check per distinct repository, without adding an employee-facing control.
  The completed 2026-07-31 release plan added bare `my meetings`/`my support`
  list defaults, a safe runtime-state boundary for organization skills,
  policy-at-invocation guidance and projection, session refresh, and an
  approachable site walkthrough centered on the employee's `my ai` command.
  Sandbox BDD plus independent live read-only checks proved governed behavior,
  fail-closed digest drift, role scoping, and non-governed zero noise.
  Automatic revocation quarantine stays experimental behind its own unmet
  drill gate and is not part of the recommended beta surface.
  Plans: [governed organizations](docs/plans/2026-07-16-governed-organizations.md),
  [completion gates](docs/plans/2026-07-21-governed-organizations-completion.md),
  and [policy at invocation](docs/plans/2026-07-22-policy-at-invocation.md).
- **Shipped (v0.36.0) — target-aware coordinated publishing.** Automatic sync and session
  publication route each exact Gnit roster member through coordinated publish
  while leaving unrostered checkouts on the guarded built-in path. The shared
  planner, scope preflight, dry-run parity, and doctor topology report were
  jointly reviewed and dogfooded. Plan:
  [target-aware Gnit publishing](docs/plans/2026-07-22-target-aware-gnit-publishing.md).
- **Shipped (v0.35.0) — dogfood ergonomics audit.** A reviewed two-agent audit
  of real operator transcripts produced small self-healing CLI fixes: clearer
  held-back sync reasons, publish-path warnings, session dead-end recovery,
  manifest control-plane publish paths, customer-record creation, and duplicate
  guidance dedupe. Plan:
  [my-cli footgun audit](docs/plans/2026-06-30-mycli-footgun-audit.md).
- **Shipped — control/data-plane split (v0.13.x).** A private manifest repo
  (the control plane) separate from workspace content repos (the data plane);
  `my publish` creates the private remotes; auto-publishing is gated on
  record adoption (`my record adopt`, Git intent-to-add). Plans:
  [single-checkout workspace](docs/plans/2026-06-10-single-checkout-workspace.md),
  [execution plane](docs/plans/2026-06-10-execution-plane.md) (safety patch).
- **Shipped — work sessions, Mode A (v0.14.0–v0.17.0).** `my work
  start|status|list|resume|finish`: visible `work/<id>` git worktrees per
  session, a session registry consulted by `my sync` and `my doctor`,
  session-aware content commands, and opt-in launches via
  `my ai --new-session`, `--session`, and `-r`/`--resume` (base umbrella
  remains the default). Session guidance now includes concrete startup context
  and is refreshed on resume.
  Plan: [execution plane](docs/plans/2026-06-10-execution-plane.md), Mode A.
- **Shipped — session command/layout consolidation (v0.34.0).** `my session
  start|join|resume|status|list|finish` is the primary noun; `my work` remains
  a deprecated compatibility alias. New sessions use `sessions/<id>` and
  `my/session/<id>` with noun-free default ids; active legacy `work/<id>`
  sessions migrate lazily through session commands or `my doctor --fix`.
  Creating a session now prints id/path plus `join` and finish hints.
  Plan:
  [session command ergonomics](docs/plans/2026-06-18-session-command-ergonomics-design.md).
- **Shipped — products/repos split (v0.15.0).** Catalog products are pure
  business entities (no `git_url`) that may link implementing repos;
  organization repositories live in `catalog/repos.json` with an `my repos`
  noun and `--repo` launch flags, cloned under `repos/<id>`. Plan:
  [products/repos split](docs/plans/2026-06-11-products-repos-split.md).
- **Shipped — roles and services, Mode A (v0.18.0).** Manifest `roles` and
  `services` sections describing the organization's remote surfaces (APIs,
  MCP servers, gated brokers), `my services`/`my roles` inspection verbs,
  `my setup --role`, umbrella-root `.mcp.json` materialized from checked-in
  or inline connection data — references only, never secrets or network
  fetches — and doctor service-health checks. Plans:
  [execution plane](docs/plans/2026-06-10-execution-plane.md),
  [v0.18 scope](docs/plans/2026-06-12-v018-scope.md).
- **Shipped — CLI package refactor (v0.19.0).** The `internal/cli` package
  and its tests are split into cohesive per-domain files, leaving `cli.go`
  as a small app core/dispatcher/update shell and `cli_test.go` as shared
  helpers plus cross-cutting tests. Plan:
  [CLI package refactor](docs/plans/2026-06-12-cli-package-refactor.md).
- **Shipped — contract rules and verbs (v0.20.0-v0.21.0).** A built-in Fleet
  Work Contract in generated guidance and the bundled self-skill (start fleet
  work from `my fleet get`, record it in support records, carry identifiers),
  a support-record next-step hint in `my fleet get` output, a manifest
  `contract` list of short, binding org rules rendered as an
  `## Organization Contract` section in `AGENTS.md`, and
  `my contract list` plus `my admin contract add|remove` for the standard
  inspect/review-commit-push workflow. Plan:
  [contract rules](docs/plans/2026-06-12-contract-rules.md).
- **Shipped — customer records move to the data plane (v0.22.0).**
  `my customers list` now reads mounted `customers/*.md` records, customer
  alias resolution still feeds meetings/support/fleet filters, and
  `my admin customers add|edit` plus manifest `catalog/customers.json`
  loading/validation are removed.
  Plan: [data surfaces](docs/plans/2026-06-13-data-surfaces.md), Slice 1.
- **Shipped — data bindings over surfaces (v0.23.0).** Manifest `data_bindings`
  maps stable operational data nouns (`customers`, `meetings`, `support`,
  `fleet`) to existing `mount:<id>` or `service:<id>` surfaces. Mount-backed
  bindings narrow today's local record commands; service-backed domain
  invocation remains deferred. Plan:
  [data surfaces](docs/plans/2026-06-13-data-surfaces.md), Slice 2.
- **Shipped — domain notes over bound surfaces (v0.24.0).** Data bindings can
  carry labeled guidance fragments for their backing surfaces without changing
  the top-level org contract. This completes the near-term data-surface scope;
  service-backed domain invocation and contained runners remain future/YAGNI.
  Plan:
  [data surfaces](docs/plans/2026-06-13-data-surfaces.md), Slice 3.
- **Shipped — contained runner launch projection (v0.25.0).** Org-side
  launch-artifact projection (`my compile`): manifest + role + skills +
  mounts compile into a deterministic Clawdapus-facing JSON artifact for
  governed fleet agents, with baseline and manifest contract blocks preserved
  as enforce-level inputs. The Clawdapus pod/context emitter and descriptor
  fetch/cache remain later phases.
  Plans: [compile launch projection](docs/plans/2026-06-14-compile-launch-plan.md),
  [execution plane](docs/plans/2026-06-10-execution-plane.md).
- **Shipped (v0.26.0) — human onboarding walkthrough.** `my onboard` introduced
  a minimal human tour; `my setup` stays the deterministic machine configurator,
  with explicit `my setup --interactive` for prompting. Tour completion is
  stored umbrella-local; no new top-level verbs such as `configuration`,
  `configure`, or `tour`. Plan:
  [onboarding walkthrough](docs/plans/2026-06-14-onboarding-walkthrough.md).
- **Shipped (v0.27.0) — launch-scoped skill composition.** `my ai` composes
  manifest profile/skill selectors into disposable `.agents/skills` state under
  the launch root, with harness mirrors where a launch-root seam exists.
  Automatic setup/sync/doctor paths stop installing organization skills globally
  for launch-root-capable harnesses; OpenCode remains compatibility-global until
  a project-local skill seam is proven; the global `my-cli` self-skill remains
  during migration. Gemini harness support was removed entirely in favor of
  Antigravity (`agy`). Plans:
  [launch-scoped skill composition](docs/plans/2026-06-14-launch-scoped-skill-composition.md),
  [ADR 0001](docs/decisions/0001-launch-scoped-skill-composition.md).
- **Shipped (v0.29.0), refined after dogfood — model-driven onboarding.**
  `my onboarding [--harness NAME]` launches a harness with the bundled `my-cli`
  self-skill's Agent-Operated Onboarding guidance, and `my onboard` remains a
  compatibility alias. The launcher chooses AUTHOR vs JOIN from manifest state,
  uses direct harness exec for zero-manifest bootstrap, reuses `my ai --setup`
  when a manifest exists, and now teaches through split-pane command sets
  instead of an `OK` handshake. Onboarding stays focused on basic human
  workflows: launch harnesses, start/resume/finish sessions, check sync/doctor,
  and paste raw context into harness chat for agents to operate deeper record
  and admin commands. Publish remains behind `my publish --print` plus explicit
  human approval. Plan:
  [model-driven onboarding](docs/plans/2026-06-15-model-driven-onboarding.md).
- **Shipped (v0.33.0) — default manifests and self-skill rename.** With
  multiple registered manifests, commands resolve explicit `--manifest`, then
  the current umbrella's manifest, then the registry default; `my manifests
  default [<name>] [--clear]` inspects or repoints that fallback. The bundled
  public self-skill install slug is now `my-cli`, while canonical id `my:self`
  remains stable and managed legacy `my` installs migrate automatically.
  Plan:
  [skill rename](docs/plans/2026-06-16-skill-rename-my-to-my-cli.md).
- **Later — substrate upgrades.** Managed read-only base mounts for contained
  launches. Target-aware Gnit publishing for sessions and ordinary sync is now
  implemented in the active issue #32 plan above. Plan:
  [execution plane](docs/plans/2026-06-10-execution-plane.md).

This section is kept current with every release and direction change; the
per-plan status lives in [docs/plans/README.md](docs/plans/README.md).

## Design Documentation

- [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — the design: concepts, the
  manifest schema, umbrella shape, mount scoping, skill resolution, the
  agents-primary philosophy, and the public/private boundary.
- [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md) — public-safe implementation plan: current
  baseline, active direction, and non-goals.
- [docs/plans/](docs/plans/README.md) — long-form design plans with a status
  index (active / shipped / superseded). Start with
  [the execution plane](docs/plans/2026-06-10-execution-plane.md) for where
  the CLI is headed: sessions, contained runners, and organization services.
- [examples/acme-workspace](examples/acme-workspace) — neutral split
  manifest/content fixture for local development.

## Dependencies

Go standard library only. No third-party Go dependencies, by policy — supply
chain surface is part of the threat model for a tool that installs things.

## Contributing

The public repo carries the generic CLI and its tests only. Fixtures and
examples use neutral placeholders (`acme`, `example`, `sampleco`). If a change
would require organization-specific data to test, the test belongs against a
private manifest, not here. `go test ./...` and `go vet ./...` must pass.
